# Learning Guides

This folder contains short, hands-on learning guides for the major technologies and entities used by this application. Each guide follows a consistent template:

- Why it’s used
- Core concepts to learn
- Hands-on micro-tasks (3 incremental exercises you can do in this repo)
- Files to inspect in this project (links)
- Recommended resources
- Quick checks / commands

Pick a guide and follow the micro-tasks to gain working knowledge of that piece of the system.
